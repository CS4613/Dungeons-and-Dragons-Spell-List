# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Spell-List-

Application Title:
*N/A*

Temporary Title:
Spell list for Dungeons and Dragons

### Developer(s):
* Daniel Woodard
* Joseph Hays
* Jeffrey Ratton

### Description: 
An app to be an easy access to commonly needed infomation while playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons.
In the first draft of the application we are mainly heading for the spells that exist in the game. As the amount of spells
number nearly 400 in the baseline of D&D. As of now there is 361 spells in our database to search through inside of the app.
We hope that a user could search by name, components, and other such search terms to be able to look at how a spell works on
the fly. We hope that we can make it so they can also build a favorites list of spells. Inside of a favorites list a user could most likely host every spell that their current champion uses to keep it close at hand.

More features to come: 
including dice roll, counter keeper, hp tracker, spell tracker, etc.
