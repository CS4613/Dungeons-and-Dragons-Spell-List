# Dungeons-and-Dragons-Spell-List-

Application Title:
*N/A*

Temporary Title:
Spell list for Dungeons and Dragons

### Developer(s):
* Daniel Woodard
* Joseph Hays
* Jeffrey Ratton

### Description: 
An app to be an easy access to commonly needed infomation while playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons.
In the first draft of the application we are mainly heading for the spells that exist in the game. As the amount of spells
number nearly 400 in the baseline of D&D. As of now there is 361 spells in our database to search through inside of the app.
We hope that a user could search by name, components, and other such search terms to be able to look at how a spell works on
the fly. We hope that we can make it so they can also build a favorites list of spells. Inside of a favorites list a user could most likely host every spell that their current champion uses to keep it close at hand. This description as is, is the baseline of the app
and can most likely be considered our finished product.

### Simple Description:
An app that holds the majority of the spells to be found in D&D. A finished product can be seen as a spell list along with a
description of each spell. Along with the spell list there should be an ability to store selected spells into smaller lists.
Another base wanted feature would be a search feature. This is the base of the app and can be seen as a useable application.

Visuals: Is a goal but isn't high on the list at the moment.
With colors, text size, and other such changes in the back of our minds.

More features to come: (That we want to add in before the end)
including dice roll, counter keeper (Training marks or how many times downed or ect...), hp tracker, spell tracker, etc. 

More features to come: (if time allows)
Character creator, Items, Create Spells, Create Item, Pets, Monsters, Nat list (Both 20 and 1), Status effects.

TimeLine: Very tentative due to other class work popping up out of the blue so short, simple, not many details.
